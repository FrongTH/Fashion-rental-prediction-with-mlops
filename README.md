# MLOps Zoomcamp Project: Fashion-rental-prediction

## Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to develop a robust and scalable solution for predicting optimal rental prices for fashion items. By accurately forecasting rental prices, fashion owners can maximize their revenue and ensure competitive pricing for end-users. This solution will integrate seamlessly into the existing business processes, ensuring continuous delivery and deployment of machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Fashion rental owners face challenges in determining the best rental prices for their inventory. Setting prices too high can deter potential customers, while prices set too low can lead to missed revenue opportunities. The objective is to build an intelligent system that dynamically predicts rental prices based on various factors such as item popularity, seasonal trends, historical data, and customer preferences.

## Objectives
### 1.Understand Cloud Integration:

Utilize cloud services to store data, train models, and deploy the solution, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

### 2.Implement Experiment Tracking and Model Registry:

Use tools like MLflow or DVC to track experiments, manage model versions, and ensure the best models are used in production.
Establish Workflow Orchestration:

Implement orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or Kubeflow to automate and manage ML workflows efficiently.
Ensure Robust Model Deployment:

Deploy models using Kubernetes, Docker, or cloud-native services to ensure scalable and reliable model serving.
Implement Model Monitoring:

Set up monitoring systems to track model performance in production, detect drifts, and trigger retraining processes.
Ensure Reproducibility:

Establish practices for reproducible research, including version control, environment management, and data provenance.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Unit Tests: Implement unit tests to verify individual components of the ML pipeline.
Integration Tests: Develop integration tests to ensure the end-to-end functionality of the pipeline.
Code Quality: Use linters and code formatters to maintain code quality and consistency.
Automation: Create a Makefile to automate common tasks and use pre-commit hooks for code validation.
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, integration, and deployment processes.
